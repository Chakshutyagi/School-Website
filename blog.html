                <h2> Our Certificate & online programs for 2021</h2>
                <p>Sunbeam group of educational institutions maintains a centralized body (QC,R&D - Quality Control, Research & Development) for quality assurance to maintain excellence and to check the quality standards of all 17 institutions under its aegis. <br>The team not only guides the teachers but also helps in maintaining a certain 'distinction' in the functioning of all the branches by sharing and training through sessions/programs leading to their up gradation of the school standards.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Students who are part of Sunbeam are groomed by the school to understand that education is for improving the lives of others and for leaving your community and world better than you found it.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Value based learning never loses its relevance no matter what the state of technological development is. Education today has to be the confluence of the best of the East and the West.</p>

       <h4>About Us</h4>
       <p>unbeam was founded in 1972 by Dr.Amrit lal ‘Ishrat Madhok and Mrs. Deesh ‘ Ishrat’ Madhok, who felt the need of a private educational institution to cater to the holistic educational needs of the students fraternity in Varanasi and thus was born Sunbeam. <br>Sunbeam started its momentous journey in a small rented apartment. <br>Armed with a vision plus boundless energy and gaining credibility by the day, giant strides were made and the young institution grew rapidly in enrolment, quality and community recognition</p>
